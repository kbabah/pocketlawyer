- [ ] Search functionality works correctly
- [ ] Typing indicators display appropriately
- [ ] Scroll to bottom button appears and functions correctly

## Testing Methodology
1. Manual testing across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. Device testing on desktop, tablet, and mobile
3. Keyboard-only navigation testing
4. Screen reader testing for key interactions
5. Performance testing with large message datasets

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved user experience compared to the original interface
- Consistent behavior across all devices and browsers
- Full accessibility compliance
- Maintained performance with the enhanced UI

## Issues Tracking
Any issues discovered during testing will be documented with:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots or recordings when applicable
- Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
