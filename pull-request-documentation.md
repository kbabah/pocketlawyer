## Integration Considerations

All four features have been designed to work together harmoniously and integrate with the existing codebase. Special attention was paid to:

1. **Consistent Design Language**: All new components follow the existing design system using Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components.

2. **Internationalization**: All features support both English and French languages through the existing language context.

3. **Theme Support**: All components work correctly in both light and dark modes.

4. **Performance**: Care was taken to ensure new features don't negatively impact page load times or runtime performance.

5. **Accessibility**: All components are keyboard navigable and screen reader compatible.

## Deployment Recommendations

We recommend deploying these features in the following order:

1. Legal Terminology Tooltips
2. Example AI Interactions
3. Progressive Form Completion
4. Post-Registration Onboarding Flow

This sequence allows for incremental improvements to the user experience while minimizing potential disruption.

## Future Considerations

While implementing these features, we identified several opportunities for future enhancements:

1. **Analytics Integration**: Add tracking to measure the effectiveness of each feature.

2. **A/B Testing**: Implement variants of the example AI interactions and progressive form to determine optimal configurations.

3. **Expanded Terminology Database**: Continue to grow the legal terminology database with more terms and categories.

4. **Personalized Onboarding**: Tailor the onboarding experience based on user preferences and behavior.

These considerations are documented for potential inclusion in future development cycles.
